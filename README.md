# React is a Lifestyle

[GDIMPLS]: http://gdiminneapolis.com "Girl, Develop It! Minneapolis Chapter"

In a recent [GDIMPLS] class, "Intermediate JavaScript", the class was learning about JS libraries and frameworks. The analogy was made the something was just a library if it was collection of tools, while a framework was a lifestyle. Somewhat tongue-in-cheek, nevertheless, still fairly true. The distinction is once you start with a framework, you generally stay within that framework, and never mix in other frameworks. Whereas with a library you can pick and choose what tools to use, and pick up other libraries' tools as well.

To illustrate why React is a framework, we'll redo the Counter example from that class.

**NOTE:** this isn't meant as a tutorial, just an illustration.
